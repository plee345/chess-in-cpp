# chess-in-cpp
A simplistic chess game made in c++ to help reinforce classes and file linking.
<br>
Built using Visual Studio 22, the general structure of the program is to separate the different components of the game(pieces, board, special cases) into different files that will then link together into a game loop in the main.cpp file.
